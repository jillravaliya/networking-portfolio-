# Firewall

##  Why Firewalls Exist?  

Imagine this:  

- Your house is connected to the outside world via a main door.  
- Friends, family, delivery people can come in, but strangers might try to break in.  

You need **security rules**:  
- Allow mom in anytime  
- Allow delivery people only at certain times  
- Block burglars completely  

**A firewall is exactly like this “security door” for your network:**  

- **Your network = house**  
- **Internet = outside world**  
- **Firewall = gatekeeper controlling who comes in and goes out**  

Without a firewall:  
- Any device outside could try to connect, scan, or attack your systems.  
- Sensitive data (like passwords, internal servers) could be compromised.

## Scratch Definition  

**Firewall = a network security device or software that monitors, filters, and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.**  

**Purpose** → Protect network from unauthorized access or attacks.  

**Types:**  
- **Hardware** → Physical device at network boundary  
- **Software** → Runs on devices or servers  
- **Cloud firewalls** → Managed service filtering traffic in cloud VPCs  

---

## Why Firewalls?  

- **Network Security** → Prevent unauthorized access  
- **Traffic Filtering** → Control which apps or services can communicate  
- **Protection against attacks** → DDoS, malware, phishing, port scanning  
- **Monitoring & Logging** → Detect suspicious activity  
- **Cloud Security** → Protect VPC, cloud instances, and SaaS apps

## Firewall Mechanics (Deeper)  

Firewalls operate at multiple layers of the OSI model:  

| Layer       | Role in Firewall |
|-------------|------------------|
| Network (L3)| Filters IP addresses, routing-based decisions |
| Transport (L4)| Filters TCP/UDP ports, checks connection state |
| Application (L7)| Inspects payloads, blocks specific applications or protocols |
| Identity & Context| Checks user identity, device type, time, geo-location |

### Packet Journey Through Firewall  

Example packet:  

```
Src IP: 203.0.113.10
Src Port: 54321
Dst IP: 192.168.1.50
Dst Port: 22 (SSH)
Protocol: TCP
```

**Firewall checks:**  
1. **Header** → IP, port, protocol  
2. **Connection state** → Is this part of a valid session (TCP handshake)?  
3. **Payload (NGFW)** → Is this real SSH traffic, or malicious content disguised?  

**Decision:**  
- **Allow** → forward to destination  
- **Deny** → drop + log

## Types of Firewalls (Deeper Understanding)  

- **Packet Filtering**  
  - Oldest type, fast.  
  - Checks IPs, ports, protocol.  
  - Cannot check payload.  

- **Stateful Inspection**  
  - Tracks session state.  
  - Allows packets only if part of valid connection (e.g., TCP handshake).  

- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**  
  - Deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, app control.  
  - Identifies specific apps (Skype, Dropbox, BitTorrent).  
  - Supports **user identity + role-based rules**.  

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**  
  - Protects web apps.  
  - Blocks SQL injection, XSS, application-layer attacks.

## Firewall in Cloud  

- **AWS** → Security Groups + Network ACLs  
- **Azure** → Network Security Groups + Azure Firewall  
- **GCP** → VPC Firewall Rules  

**Deep Cloud Concept:**  
- Private subnet (`10.0.2.0/24`) cannot reach internet directly.  
- **NAT Gateway + Security Groups** → control outbound.  
- **VPN + Firewall** → secure + control remote traffic.  

---

## Practical Commands / Setup  

**Linux (iptables):**  

```bash
# Allow SSH
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow HTTP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Block everything else
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
```

## Limitations of Firewalls (Deep)  

Cannot stop threats bypassing firewall (USB malware, insider).  
Encrypted traffic may hide attacks (needs SSL inspection).  
Misconfigurations = open door for attackers.  
Stateful firewalls may fail under huge DDoS.  

---

## Security Considerations  

**Best Practices:**  
- Principle of least privilege → allow only required traffic.  
- Layered security → firewall + IDS/IPS + VPN + antivirus.  
- Regular audits → remove outdated rules.  
- Use **cloud-native firewalls** for hybrid networks.  

---

## Summary 

Firewall = **multi-layered security guard**:  

- **L3 → IP check**  
- **L4 → Port/protocol check**  
- **L7 → Content/application check**  

Works with:  
- **VPN** → secure remote connections  
- **NAT** → works on translated IPs  
- **Cloud firewalls** → software-defined scalable rules  

**Strategy = Defense in Depth** → combine firewalls + monitoring + threat intelligence.
